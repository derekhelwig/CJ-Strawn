					<p>"We were lucky to find CJ Strawn. Moving to a new community from half-way across the country was easier for us because CJ and Steve knew the anxiety 
						we were feeling about moving to a new place, knew the community in and out and were great at showing us the pluses and minuses of each potential home. 
						In the end, we got the house of our dreams and it wouldn't have happened without her high degree of professionalism and being a strong advocate for us. 
						We've since recommended them to others not just because of what we experienced, but because of the fact they are truly good people and have become friends."
					</p>

					<p>"Your help and expertise with finding the most suitable home for us and our family was the most pleasant experience. Your willingness, patience, and knowledge 
						of the area and what we were looking for was outstanding! We are very pleased with our most important investment and very thankful for the great work you did!!"
					</p>
					<p class="signature">- Nick and Samantha George, Columbia, MO</p>
					
					<p>"Thanks for making buying my house painless. Having moved here from Chicago only a year ago, I really didn't know what was available. Once I told you what 
						section of town I wanted to live in and what my requirements were you steered me to houses that fit these requirements. I appreciate that you didn't try to 
						sell me something more expensive than what I wanted. You've helped me in everything from finding the house, dealing with the previous owners, who to go to 
						for a loan, getting all the inspections, and finding movers. I've bought houses in other cities and have never had such comprehensive service fromm my agent. 
						And the best part is that you made it fun, too.<br><br>
						I can only say Thanks a Million!"

					<p>"Just a little reminder of how much you rock! Thank you so much for fighting for us and making our first home purchase a breeze! Your professionalism, 
						expertise and friendship really mean a lot to us and we are infinitely grateful!"</p>
					<p class="signature">- Jennifer and Eric Butterwick, Columbia, MO</p>
					
					<p>"We can not begin to thank you enough for all of the help you provided in our recent purchase of a home in Columbia. Several months ago, over the Christmas Holidays, 
						our family began a serious discussion of purchasing a home in Columbia. Having 2 sons who currently attend the University of Missouri, Columbia and a younger son, 
						currently in high school, who may make the decision to attend “Mizzou”, also—it made sense to us to invest in a home in Columbia where our children could live while 
						attending college. Finding the right house was essential. Both of our sons felt the number one priority was finding a house within walking distance of campus. When 
						they went back to school after the Christmas break, they began to look for available properties for sale. We were very happy that by pure chance, through your website, 
						you became our real estate agent.
					</p>
					<p>Trying to coordinate the purchase of a home can be a challenge. However, when the home owner lives in California, the buyers live in St. Louis, 
						and the home is in Columbia—well, need we say more? To complicate matters was the fact of the burst pipe causing water damage to the kitchen and the finished part 
						of the basement. Insurance adjusters, workmen, and cleaning crews were now put within the mix.
					</p>
					<p>As difficult as all of this could have been, we have to say that the whole process went relatively smoothly! Your expertise and advice were invaluable to us. We lost 
						track of how many phone calls and e-mails were exchanged over the last few months, however you never made us feeling like we were bothering you. We are grateful that 
						you gave up your Saturdays to meet with us, as this was the only time we could make trips to Columbia. We look forward to owning our house, but when our children have 
						all completed their college educations, and it is time for us to move on from Columbia—you can be assured that you will be the first one we call when we are on the 
						seller’s end!"
					</p>

					<p>"“Thank you for making our home buying experience easy and enjoyable! You knew the market and were even able to help us with the loan process. What a delightful 
						person to work with – We will absolutely recommend you to anyone we know that is looking for a home!"
					</p>
					<p class="signature">- Kevin and Debbie Thompson, Columbia</p>
					
					<p>"“Most of all, thank you for your patience and hard work helping us purchase our ‘little piece of dirt’. We will definitely be recommending you to our friends!"
					</p>
					<p class="signature">- Patricia and Chris David, Sycamore, IL</p>
					
					<p>"“We had a great time looking for our home. We never felt pressured and were amazed at how hard you worked on our behalf. You made the process smooth and enjoyable 
					and you were extremely professional and personable. Thank you."
					</p>
					<p class="signature">- David East and Catherine Gleason</p>

 					<p>"“My family and I recently moved to Columbia from Yazoo, MS. CJ worked to find a home perfectly suited for our needs and budget. CJ put extra effort in finding the 
 					right situation for our family. She was patient kind and unrelenting in supporting us. We don’t know a person better qualified in personality, character or business savvy 
 					to serve homebuyers. We are thankful – we love CJ and we love our home!"
